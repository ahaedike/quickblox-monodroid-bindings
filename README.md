We are implementing QuickBlox chat feature in a Xamarin project.  Currently, we have only integrated the Chat feature so the binding has only been tested for that feature.  This is a work in progress that will be updated as the project matures.

Be sure you have at least Java 1.7.x installed to complile:

$ java -version

java version "1.7.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)
